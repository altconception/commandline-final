# commandline-final
Final project for commandline class. Went back and updated this after class was over, and am now putting it on here.

This project basically includes three random tasks that I thought would be interesting to try out in PowerShell scripting. 

The first option gives you several different methods of sorting local ports.

The second option lets you sort files in your home directory. Perhaps further implementation will let you choose a folder to start in. 
That will probably be the next update.

The third option installs Windows Subsystem for Linux, and gives you several options for distrobutions to choose from. It then opens WSL in your terminal.

The fourth option closes the script.

To do:
-Upgrade functionallity of option 2 to let the user choose a folder to start in
-Add a 5th option that installs Vim with Chocolatey
